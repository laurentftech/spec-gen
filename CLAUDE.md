# spec-gen MCP tools — when to use them

| Situation | Tool |
|-----------|------|
| Starting any new task | `orient` — returns functions, files, specs, call paths, and insertion points in one call |
| Don't know which file/function handles a concept | `search_code` |
| Need call topology across many files | `get_subgraph` / `analyze_impact` |
| Planning where to add a feature | `suggest_insertion_points` |
| Reading a spec before writing code | `get_spec` |
| Checking if code still matches spec | `check_spec_drift` |
| Finding spec requirements by meaning | `search_specs` |
| Checking spec coverage before starting a feature | `audit_spec_coverage` |
| Recording an architectural decision before writing code | `record_decision` |

For all other cases (reading a file, grepping, listing files) use native tools directly.

## Architectural decisions

When making a significant design choice, call `record_decision` **before** writing the code.

Significant choices: data structure, library/dependency, API contract, auth strategy,
module boundary, database schema, caching approach, error handling pattern.

```
record_decision({
  title: "Use JWTs for stateless auth",
  rationale: "Avoids session store in infra",
  consequences: "Tokens can't be revoked early",
  affectedFiles: ["src/auth/middleware.ts"],
  supersedes: "a1b2c3d4"  // 8-char ID of prior decision being reversed
})
```

Decisions are consolidated and cross-checked against the git diff before each commit.
