## Purpose

TaskFlow is a task management REST API that enables teams to organize work into
projects and tasks with role-based access control and real-time status tracking.

## Domains

- **auth**: Authentication (login, registration, JWT tokens) and authorization (role-based middleware)
- **tasks**: Task CRUD operations, status transitions, filtering, and assignment
- **projects**: Project management, membership, and archival
- **database**: PostgreSQL connection pooling and health checks

## API Surface

All endpoints live under `/api/` and require Bearer token authentication except
`/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`, and `/health`.
